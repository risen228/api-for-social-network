# API For Social Network

## Developing

Prerequisites:
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)

Running locally:
1. Create `.env` file: `cp .env.example .env`
   - You may need to fill/change some variables
2. Launch postgres: `yarn start:docker`
   - After finishing development, you can shut down the containers by running `yarn stop:docker`
3. Wait for docker containers to start up
4. Create and migrate the database: `yarn prisma migrate dev`
   - You must run this command every time you make changes to `prisma/schema.prisma`
5. Run the application in watch mode: `yarn start:dev`
6. Congratulations! Now you can access the API on `http://localhost:5050`
